    ##########################################


  In many distros the package system have conflicts dependencies.

  TCOS need some packages that conflicts, for example esound and pulseaudio-esound-compat.

  To have all files at image build time, I have made a small ugly trick:

    Uncompress debian packages into /var/cache/tcos/packages/PKG_NAME/
    and copy from this dir to initramfs images. Example:

            # gentcos -instpkg libesd0

  This will download libesd-x-x-x.deb and uncompress into
  /var/cache/tcos/packages/libesd0/

  For downloading we search URI with apt-get --print-uris install -y -f libesd0


  # gentcos -listpkgs will show all cache packages installed.
