Release notes
=============

   ()	The socket is kept open as long as possible.
	After about 100 reads, a new socket has to be used.
	Does anybody know why? 
   
   ()	httpfs_read returns an I/O-error even in case of partial success.
   
   ()	Seems a bit more reliable than previous release(s).

CONTENTS
========

httpfs		Binary, compiled with gcc-2.95 against Fuse 2.5.3
httpfs.c	Source
make_httpfs	Bash-Script to build httpfs
readme		This file
readme.1	Basic information from branch 1 of httpfs

Added Features
==============

   ()	The second branch of httpfs doesn't demand an empty directory as mount point.
	Since the directoty content stays accessible, this becomes a benefit.
	(It's closer to the 'instant download' metaphor.)

   ()	If compiled with defined USE_AUTH an URL of the form
		http://user:pass@host/file
	allows basic authorization.
	The parser just grabs everything between :// and @. Be warned.
	By the way. You can also specify a port other then the implied 80.

Warning
=======

   ()	If you rename a downloaded file and have write rights for the directory,
	you actually copy the file, i.e. you make a 'full' download.

Supplementation
===============

   ()	It's strongly recommended to unmount
		fusermount -u mount-point
	before you disconnect.
   ()	Branch 1 of httpfs isn't outdated by this one.
