In other words:
It seems to be an instant download of big.iso to local_dir

Fuse-headers for compiling.


STATUS

First Release. Kept it as simple as possible.


CONTENTS

httpfs.c	Source
make_httpfs	Bash-Script to build httpfs
readme		This file


INTENTION
=========

I wanted a 'glue' to handle an ISO, which is only accessible by http,
with loop device. That is something like httpdisk from Bo Brantén.
(http://www.acc.umu.se/~bosse/	-- driver for windows)

It's a design decision, not to use a fancy libaray like libcurl.
Also there is no idea, to incorporate curlftp or even webdav.

The result is only gradually more complex than hello.c from fuse.

But --
in another branch i'm willing to add a few more features.
